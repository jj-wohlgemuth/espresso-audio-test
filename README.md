# espresso-audio-test

Some time ago someone approached me and said they need some code for production testing of consumer audio stuff. I asked what kind of machine the code will run on. They said JVM. I asked when they need it. They said yesterday. So, I made myself an expresso and started learning Java. The next day I had this somewhat functional thing. I have not used Java before or after this, but the experience was much more pleasant than I assumed.
